# README for Collective Roots (CR) Repo 

## What is in this repo? 
   Chunks of code I wrote for the [Collective Roots Alternative Peer Group](https://www.collectiverootsapg.org/) redesign. This is a square space site.  I wrote some simple code to create a jump link from our CTA donate button to the donation form on the [Support Us](https://www.collectiverootsapg.org/support-us) page. 

   The accessibility statement and terms and conditions are/ were from templates that I modified. The non-profit's goal is to support teens struggling with addiction, which means many target users of the site are teenagers and not of legal age.
    I modified the terms and conditions to allow for users 13 and older to interact with the site while following Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) guidelines. (Standard Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer nor do I play one on TV. I did consult Chat GPT for this part)
